                        <p>This month's artist is Michael Cassini. Michael has been a professional sculptor for ten years. He has won numerous awards, including the prestigious Reichsman Cup and an Award of Merit at the 1997 Tuscany Arts Competition. </p>
                        <p>Michael specializes in recreations of gargoyles from European cathedrals. You'll usually find Michael staring intently at the church walls in northern France. His work is represented by the Turin Gargoyle, a great entry to our Gargoyle Collection.
